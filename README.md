[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/vaultplay-draw-worker/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

A Cloudflare Worker implementation for transparent, verifiable, and deterministic prize draws. This system ensures fairness and reproducibility for all participants through cryptographic methods and public auditability.

## üéØ Features

- **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses SHA-256 hashing for deterministic scoring
- **Publicly Auditable**: All draw results can be independently verified
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce the same results
- **Transparent**: Open-source algorithm with comprehensive documentation
- **Production-Ready**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS support
- **Zero Side Effects**: No external dependencies during draw calculation

## üîí Security Highlights

- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against DoS attacks (max 1M entries)
- Rate limiting headers support
- CORS configuration for public access
- Deterministic output based on public entropy sources
- No randomness generation - uses external public randomness (e.g., drand, blockchain)

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/startdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "randomness": "dbd8372fa098b50dc58a4827e6f19ef08f5ceab89effaacf2d670e14594ba57f",
    "entries": [
      { "entryCode": "ENTRY-001" },
      { "entryCode": "ENTRY-002" },
      { "entryCode": "ENTRY-003" }
    ],
    "drawRound": "5475483"
  }'
```

## üîç Algorithm

The draw algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Generate Seed**: `seed = SHA-256(randomness)`
2. **Score Entries**: For each entry, `score = SHA-256(seed || entryCode)`
3. **Rank by Score**: Sort entries by score (descending), highest score wins
4. **Return Results**: Provide ranked results with full audit trail

### Why This Works

- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce identical results
- **Unpredictable**: Cannot predict ranking without knowing the randomness beforehand
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can reproduce the results with the same inputs
- **Fair**: All entries have equal probability before randomness is revealed

## üß™ Testing

You can verify draws independently using any SHA-256 implementation:

```javascript
// Verify the seed
const seed = SHA256(randomness);

// Verify any entry's score
const score = SHA256(seed + entryCode);
```

## üîß Configuration

Edit `CONFIG` constants in the worker code:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  MAX_ENTRIES: 1000000,           // Maximum entries per draw
  MAX_ENTRY_CODE_LENGTH: 256,     // Maximum entry code length
  MAX_RANDOMNESS_LENGTH: 1024,    // Maximum randomness length
  MAX_DRAW_ROUND_LENGTH: 64,      // Maximum draw round ID length
  ALGORITHM_VERSION: "VaultPlay Draw v1.0",
  HASH_ALGORITHM: "SHA-256"
};
```

## üìä Use Cases

- Prize drawings and giveaways
- Lottery systems
- Random selection processes
- Transparent allocation mechanisms
- Verifiable randomness applications

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Randomness Source

The security of this system depends on the quality of the randomness input:

- ‚úÖ **Recommended**: Use public, verifiable randomness sources
  - [drand](https://drand.love/) - League of Entropy's distributed randomness beacon
  - Blockchain hashes (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
  - Public lottery draws
  
- ‚ùå **Not Recommended**: Self-generated or private randomness

### Audit Trail

All draws include:
- Complete input parameters
- Algorithm version
- Timestamp
- Results checksum
- Full ranking with cryptographic scores
