## üîç Algorithm

The draw algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Generate Seed**: `seed = SHA-256(randomness)`
2. **Score Entries**: For each entry, `score = SHA-256(seed || entryCode)`
3. **Convert to Numeric Score**: The SHA-256 hash (64 hex characters) is interpreted as a hexadecimal number and converted to a BigInt for precise comparison
4. **Rank by Score**: Sort entries by their numeric scores in descending order - highest score wins rank 1
5. **Return Results**: Provide ranked results with full audit trail

### How Scoring Works in Detail

Each entry receives a deterministic score through this process:

```javascript
// Step 1: Generate the draw seed from randomness
seed = SHA-256("dbd8372fa098b50dc58a4827e6f19ef08f5ceab89effaacf2d670e14594ba57f")
// Result: "a1b2c3d4..." (64 hex characters)

// Step 2: Score each entry by hashing seed + entryCode
scoreHex = SHA-256(seed + "ENTRY-001")
// Result: "f3e4d5c6b7a89012..." (64 hex characters)

// Step 3: Convert hex to decimal number for comparison
score = BigInt("0x" + scoreHex)
// Result: 112233445566778899... (very large integer)

// Step 4: All entries are sorted by their numeric scores
// Highest score = Rank 1 (winner)
```

The hexadecimal hash output is treated as a base-16 number and converted to decimal for precise numeric comparison. This ensures:
- Every entry gets a unique, unpredictable score
- Scores can be compared mathematically to determine ranking
- The process is fully deterministic and reproducible

### Why This Works

- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce identical results
- **Unpredictable**: Cannot predict ranking without knowing the randomness beforehand
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can reproduce the results with the same inputs
- **Fair**: All entries have equal probability before randomness is revealed
- **Collision-resistant**: SHA-256 makes it virtually impossible for two entries to have the same score

## üß™ Testing

You can verify draws independently using any SHA-256 implementation:

```javascript
// Example verification in JavaScript:

// 1. Verify the seed generation
const seed = SHA256("your-randomness-input");
console.log("Seed:", seed);

// 2. Verify any entry's score
const scoreHex = SHA256(seed + "ENTRY-001");
console.log("Score (hex):", scoreHex);

// 3. Convert to numeric value for ranking
const scoreDecimal = BigInt("0x" + scoreHex);
console.log("Score (decimal):", scoreDecimal.toString());

// 4. Verify the ranking by comparing numeric scores
// The entry with the highest numeric score gets rank 1
```

### Online Verification Tools

You can manually verify draws using:
- [SHA-256 Hash Generator](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)
- Any programming language's crypto library (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Command line: `echo -n "input" | shasum -a 256`

### Example Verification

Given:
- Randomness: `abc123`
- Entry: `ENTRY-001`

Steps:
1. Seed = SHA-256(`abc123`) = `6ca13d52ca70c883e0f0bb101e425a89e8624de51db2d2392593af6a84118090`
2. Score = SHA-256(`6ca13d52ca70c883e0f0bb101e425a89e8624de51db2d2392593af6a84118090ENTRY-001`)
3. Score (hex) = `a7f3e4d2c1b0a9f8e7d6c5b4a3f2e1d0c9b8a7f6e5d4c3b2a1f0e9d8c7b6a5f4`
4. Score (decimal) = Convert hex to BigInt for comparison

## üîß Configuration

### Worker Configuration

Edit `CONFIG` constants in the worker code:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  MAX_ENTRIES: 100000,              // Maximum entries per draw
  MAX_ENTRY_CODE_LENGTH: 256,       // Maximum entry code length
  MAX_RANDOMNESS_LENGTH: 1024,      // Maximum randomness length
  MAX_DRAW_ROUND_LENGTH: 64,        // Maximum draw round ID length
  MAX_COMPETITION_NAME_LENGTH: 256, // Maximum competition name length
  MAX_COMPETITION_ID_LENGTH: 128,   // Maximum competition ID length
  ALGORITHM_VERSION: "VaultPlay Draw v1.2",
  HASH_ALGORITHM: "SHA-256"
};
```

### Environment Variables

For automatic audit bundle publishing to GitHub, configure these environment variables in Cloudflare:

**Required for GitHub Publishing:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub Personal Access Token (fine-grained recommended)
  - Permissions needed: Contents (read & write)
  - Set via: `wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN --env production`
  - Or via Cloudflare Dashboard: Workers & Pages ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Variables

**Optional (defaults provided):**
- `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER` - Repository owner (default: "vaultplay-dev")
- `GITHUB_REPO_NAME` - Repository name (default: "vaultplay-draw-history")
- `GITHUB_BRANCH` - Branch name (default: "main")

Set via `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[env.production.vars]
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER = "your-github-username"
GITHUB_REPO_NAME = "your-audit-repo"
GITHUB_BRANCH = "main"
```

### GitHub Token Setup

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Configure:
   - **Token name:** VaultPlay Draw Worker
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (set calendar reminder)
   - **Repository access:** Only select repositories ‚Üí choose your audit repository
   - **Permissions:**
     - Contents: Read and write ‚úì
     - Metadata: Read-only ‚úì (automatically selected)
4. Generate and copy the token
5. Add to Cloudflare Worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN --env production
   ```

### Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Whitespace Trimming**: Entry codes and randomness are automatically trimmed
- **Hex-only Randomness**: Only accepts valid hexadecimal strings for randomness
- **Security Headers**: Includes X-Frame-Options, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure in Cloudflare Dashboard (recommended: 100 req/min)
- **CORS**: Configurable origin restrictions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Draw succeeds even if GitHub publishing fails

## üì¶ Audit Bundle & Public Verification

When competition metadata is provided, the worker automatically:
1. Generates a complete audit bundle containing all draw data
2. Commits the bundle to a GitHub repository (configurable)
3. Creates a public release for live draws
4. Returns GitHub URLs in the response

### Audit Bundle Structure

The audit bundle is a comprehensive JSON file containing:
- Competition metadata (ID, name, mode)
- Complete randomness source information
- All entries and their rankings
- Full verification data
- Bundle hash for integrity checking

### Public Audit Repository

All draws are published to a public GitHub repository for transparency:
- **Live draws:** Published in `/live/YYYY-MM/competition-name/` with public releases
- **Test draws:** Published in `/test/YYYY-MM/test-YYYY-MM-DD-###/` (commits only)

Example repository structure:
```
vaultplay-draw-history/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ live/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-01/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ january-2025-prize-draw/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ draw.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-01/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-2025-01-15-001/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ draw.json
```

### Why Test Draws Are Public

Test draws are published to demonstrate:
- Continuous system testing
- Nothing is hidden from public scrutiny
- Quality assurance processes
- Complete transparency

### Graceful Degradation

If GitHub publishing fails:
- ‚úÖ Draw still succeeds and returns results
- ‚úÖ Complete audit bundle is included in the API response
- ‚úÖ Bundle can be manually published from worker logs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Response indicates publication failure with error details

## üìä Use Cases

- Prize drawings and giveaways with full audit trails
- Lottery systems with public verification
- Random selection processes requiring transparency
- Transparent allocation mechanisms
- Verifiable randomness applications
- Competitions requiring regulatory compliance
- Any draw requiring public trust and auditability

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Randomness Source

The security of this system depends on the quality of the randomness input:

- ‚úÖ **Recommended**: Use public, verifiable randomness sources
  - [drand](https://drand.love/) - League of Entropy's distributed randomness beacon
  - Blockchain hashes (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
  - Public lottery draws
  
- ‚ùå **Not Recommended**: Self-generated or private randomness

### Audit Trail

All draws include:
- Complete input parameters
- Algorithm version
- Timestamp
- Results checksum
- Full ranking with cryptographic scores
